# VITA Frontier

> Infrastructure for tribes operating in hostile, decentralized frontiers.  
> Built to survive collapse. Designed to be forked. Refuses capture.

VITA Frontier is an **open-source tribe / corporation management tool** designed for decentralized game worlds — starting with **EVE: Frontier**.

It provides:
- Tribe / corp membership & roles
- Doctrine & cultural records
- After-action reports (AARs) and institutional memory
- Event coordination
- Identity scaffolding for on-chain worlds

It is **Web2-first** for usability, and **Web3-ready** for trust, proof, and continuity.

## Self-Host or Hosted (Your Choice)

VITA Frontier is **fully self-hostable**. Fork it. Run it. Own your stack.

If you’d rather not operate servers, VITA may offer **managed multi-tenant hosting**:
- You pay for **hosting + uptime + backups + ops**
- You do **not** pay for access to the software
- You can **export your data** at any time and leave without penalty

Hosted service entitlements may be represented **on-chain** (future), but the core app remains chain-agnostic.

## License (AGPLv3)

VITA Frontier is licensed under **AGPLv3**.

- You can use, modify, and run this software.
- If you modify it and run it as a network service, you must provide your modified source to users of that service.

This prevents silent SaaS enclosure and protects the commons.
